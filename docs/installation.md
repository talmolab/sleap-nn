# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) (optional, recommended for isolated Python environments with fast dependency resolution)
- [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/) (optional, included with Miniforge, recommended for faster dependency resolution)

## Install sleap-nn

### 1. (Optional) Install Miniforge and create environment

We recommend using [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for an isolated Python environment with fast dependency resolution. (You may skip this step if you already have a suitable Python environment.)

To create and activate development environment

```bash
mamba create -n sleap-nn-dev python=3.11
mamba activate sleap-nn-dev
```

### 2. Install `uv` and Development Dependencies

[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast and modern package manager for `pyproject.toml`-based projects.

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 3. Install PyTorch

You can either:

#### Option A: Install with Optional Dependencies (Recommended)

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[torch]"
```

This installs the default builds of `torch` and `torchvision` via PyPI for your OS. By default, this means:

- **Windows:** CPU-only build.

- **Linux:** CUDA-enabled (GPU) build (if a compatible NVIDIA GPU is detected).

- **macOS:** CPU-only build (with Metal backend support for Apple Silicon in recent versions)
If you need a different build (e.g., GPU support on Windows, or CPU-only on Linux), see the manual installation options below.

#### Option B: Manual Installation for Specific Platforms

Install the correct wheel for your system using PyTorch's index URL:

**Windows/Linux with NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 11.8):**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**macOS with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4):**
You don't need to do anything if you used the `[torch]` optional dependency or default PyPI installâ€”the default wheels now include Metal backend support for Apple GPUs.

**CPU-only (no GPU or unsupported GPU):**
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

You can find the correct wheel for your system at:

### 4. Verify Installation

Test your installation:

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests

# Optional: Lint and format code
black --check sleap_nn tests
ruff check sleap_nn/
```

## GPU Support

We recommend installing the torch dependencies manually based on your platform and intentionally **do not include GPU-specific `torch` or `torchvision` builds** in `pyproject.toml` for the below reasons:

- **No CUDA/hardware assumptions**â€”avoids install issues.
- **Flexible to choose your own PyTorch build (CPU or GPU).**
- **All other dependencies managed by `uv`.**-also faster!

> ðŸ’¡ This makes `sleap-nn` compatible with both GPU-accelerated and CPU-only environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

If you get import errors:

1. Ensure you've activated the conda environment: `mamba activate sleap-nn-dev`
2. Verify PyTorch is installed: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"`
3. Try reinstalling with torch extras: `uv pip install -e ".[torch]"`

### CUDA Issues

If you encounter CUDA-related errors:

1. Verify your NVIDIA drivers are up to date
2. Check CUDA compatibility with PyTorch version
3. Try the CPU-only installation as a fallback
