# Example Notebooks

This page provides information on how to access and use the example notebooks from the sleap-nn GitHub repository.

## Accessing Example Notebooks

The example notebooks are available in the [sleap-nn GitHub repository](https://github.com/talmolab/sleap-nn) in the `example_notebooks/` folder. These notebooks are created with [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) and provide interactive tutorials for various sleap-nn workflows.

### Getting Started with Marimo

The example notebooks use marimo, which provides a **sandboxed environment** that automatically handles all dependencies. You don't need to create a separate sleap-nn environment.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: 
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

2. **Create a new folder**:

      Clone the `sleap-nn` repo
      ```bash
      cd sleap-nn/example_notebooks
      ```
      
      Or make a new directory
      ```bash
      mkdir sleap-nn-tutorials
      ```

3. **Initialize uv**:

      Ensure the working directory where you run `uv init` doesn't have an existing `pyproject.toml`.
      ```bash
      uv init
      ```

#### Setup

1. **Add [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) to your project**:

   Ensure the working directory where you run `uv init` doesn't have an existing `pyproject.toml` as `uv add` will try to add marimo to the existing `.toml`.

   ```bash
   uv add marimo
   ```

2. **Run the marimo notebooks**

Ensure the python scripts are in your current working directory!
