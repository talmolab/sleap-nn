# Colab Notebooks

Here are Jupyter notebooks you can run on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) (Colab). Colab is great for running training and inference on your data if you don't have access to a local machine with a supported GPU.

## Available Notebooks

### [Training and Inference with sleap-nn](Training_with_sleap_nn_on_colab.ipynb)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/talmolab/sleap-nn/blob/main/docs/colab_notebooks/Training_with_sleap_nn_on_colab.ipynb)

This tutorial notebook walks through running training, inference, and evaluation workflows in sleap-nn using the Python API. You'll learn how to:

- Install sleap-nn on Colab with GPU support
- Load and configure training settings
- Run model training
- Perform inference on new data
- Evaluate model predictions against ground truth
- Visualize predictions

!!! tip "Enable GPU Runtime"
    Before running the notebook, make sure to enable GPU runtime in Colab:
    **Runtime → Change runtime type → Select "T4 GPU"**
