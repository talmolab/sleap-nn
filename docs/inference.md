# Running Inference

SLEAP-NN provides powerful inference capabilities for pose estimation with support for multiple model types, tracking, and legacy SLEAP model compatibility. SLEAP-NN supports inference on:

- **Videos**: Any format supported by OpenCV
- **SLEAP Labels**: `.slp` files

## Run Inference with CLI

```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --model_paths models/ckpt_folder/
```

To run inference on video files with specific frames
```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --frames "1-100,200-300" \
    --model_paths models/ckpt_folder/
```

To run inference with different backbone weights than the one in `models/ckpt_folder/`
```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --frames "1-100,200-300" \
    --model_paths models/ckpt_folder/ \
    --backbone_ckpt_path models/backbone.ckpt
```

For two-stage models (topdown and multiclass topdown), both the centroid and centered-instance model ckpts should be provided as given below:
```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --model_paths models/centroid_unet/ \
    --model_paths models/centered_instance_unet/
```

!!! note
    **_Note (for centroid-only inference)_**: The centroid model is essentially the first stage of TopDown model workflow, which only predicts centers, not keypoints. In centroid-only inference, each predicted centroid is matched (by Euclidean distance) to the nearest ground-truth instance, and the ground-truth keypoints are copied for display. Therefore, an OKS mAP of 1.0 just means all instances were detectedâ€”it does not reflect pose/keypoint accuracy. To evaluate keypoints, run the second stage (the pose model) rather than centroid-only inference.

### Arguments for CLI

#### Essential Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--data_path` | Path to `.slp` file or `.mp4` to run inference on | Required |
| `--model_paths` | List of paths to the directory where the best.ckpt and training_config.yaml are saved | Required |
| `--output_path` | The output filename to use for the predicted data. If not provided, defaults to '[data_path].slp' | `[input].slp` |
| `--device` | Device on which torch.Tensor will be allocated. One of ('cpu', 'cuda', 'mps', 'auto', 'opencl', 'ideep', 'hip', 'msnpu'). Default: 'auto' (based on available backend either cuda, mps or cpu is chosen) | `auto` |
| `--batch_size` | Number of frames to predict at a time. Larger values result in faster inference speeds, but require more memory | `4` |
| `--peak_threshold` | Minimum confidence map value to consider a peak as valid | `0.2` |

#### Model Configuration

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--backbone_ckpt_path` | To run inference on any `.ckpt` other than `best.ckpt` from the `model_paths` dir, the path to the `.ckpt` file should be passed here | `None` |
| `--head_ckpt_path` | Path to `.ckpt` file if a different set of head layer weights are to be used. If `None`, the `best.ckpt` from `model_paths` dir is used (or the ckpt from `backbone_ckpt_path` if provided) | `None` |

| `--ensure_grayscale` | True if the input image should only have a single channel. If input has three channels (RGB) and this is set to True, then we convert the image to grayscale (single-channel) image.

## Run inference with API

To return predictions as list of dictionaries, 

```python
from sleap_nn.predict import run_inference

# Run inference
labels = run_inference(
    data_path="video.mp4",
    model_paths=["models/unet/"],
    make_labels=False,
    return_confmaps=True
)
```

To return predictions as a `sleap_io.Labels` object, 

```python
from sleap_nn.predict import run_inference

# Run inference
labels = run_inference(
    data_path="video.mp4",
    model_paths=["models/unet/"],
    output_path="predictions.slp",
    make_labels=True,
)
```

For a detailed explanation of all available parameters for `run_inference`, see the API docs for [run_inference()](../api/inference/predictors/#sleap_nn.inference.predictors.run_inference).

## Tracking

SLEAP-NN includes sophisticated tracking capabilities for multi-instance scenarios. The output labels object (or `.slp` file) will have track IDs associated to the predicted instances (or user-labeled instances).

### Tracking Methods

#### Fixed Window Tracking

This method maintains a fixed-size window of the last N frames and uses all instances from those frames as candidates for matching.

```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --model_paths models/bottomup_unet/ \
    --tracking \
    --candidates_method fixed_window \
    --tracking_window_size 10
```

#### Local Queues Tracking

This method maintains separate queues for each track ID, keeping the last N instances per track. It's more robust to track breaks but requires more memory and computation.

```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --model_paths models/bottomup_unet/ \
    --tracking \
    --candidates_method local_queues \
    --tracking_window_size 5
```

#### Optical Flow Tracking

This method uses optical flow to shift the candidates onto the frame to be tracked and then associates the untracked instances to the shifted instances.

```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --model_paths models/bottomup_unet/ \
    --tracking \
    --use_flow
```

### Track-only workflow
You can perform tracking on existing user-labeled instancesâ€”without running inference to get new predictionsâ€”by enabling tracking (`--tracking`) and omitting the `--model-paths` argument. This will associate tracks using only the provided labels.

```bash
sleap-nn-track \
    --data_path video.mp4 \
    --tracking \
    --candidates_method fixed_window \
    --tracking_window_size 10
```

## Legacy SLEAP Model Support

SLEAP-NN supporting running inference with models trained using the original SLEAP TensorFlow/Keras backend (sleap <= 1.4), **but only for UNet backbone models**.
To run inference with legacy SLEAP models (trained with TensorFlow/Keras, sleap â‰¤ 1.4), simply use the same CLI or API workflows described above in the [With CLI](#with-cli) and [With API](#with-api) sections. 

Just provide the path to the directory containing both `best_model.h5` and `training_config.json` from your SLEAP training run as your `--model-paths` (CLI) or `model_paths` (API) argument. SLEAP-NN will automatically detect and load these legacy models for inference.


## Evaluation Metrics

SLEAP-NN provides comprehensive evaluation capabilities to assess model performance against ground truth labels.

Using CLI:
```bash
sleap-nn-eval \
    --ground_truth_path gt_labels.slp \
    --predicted_path pred_labels.slp \
    --save_metrics pred_metrics.npz \
```

Using `Evaluator` API:
```python
import sleap_io as sio
from sleap_nn.evaluation import Evaluator

# Load ground truth and predictions
gt_labels = sio.load_slp("gt_labels.slp")
pred_labels = sio.load_slp("pred_labels.slp")

# Create evaluator and compute metrics
evaluator = Evaluator(gt_labels, pred_labels)
metrics = evaluator.evaluate()

# Print results
print(f"OKS mAP: {metrics['voc_metrics']['oks_voc.mAP']}")
print(f"mOKS: {metrics['mOKS']}")
print(f"Dist. error @90th percentile: {metrics['distance_metrics']['p90']}")
```



## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Out of Memory
- Reduce `--batch_size`
- Use `--device cpu` for CPU-only inference

#### Slow Inference
- Increase `--batch_size` (if memory allows)
- Use `--device cuda` for GPU acceleration

#### Poor Predictions
- Adjust `--peak_threshold`
- Check model compatibility
- Verify input preprocessing matches training

#### Tracking Issues
- Adjust `--tracking_window_size`
- Try different feature representation and scoring method.
