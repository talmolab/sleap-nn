    """Crop bounding boxes from a batch of images.

    Args:
        images: Tensor of shape (samples, channels, height, width) of a batch of images.
        bboxes: Tensor of shape (n_bboxes, 4, 2) and dtype torch.float32, where n_bboxes
            is the number of centroids, and the second dimension represents the four
            corner points of the bounding boxes, each with x and y coordinates.
            The order of the corners follows a clockwise arrangement: top-left,
            top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left. This can be generated from
            centroids using `make_centered_bboxes`.
        sample_inds: Tensor of shape (n_bboxes,) specifying which samples each bounding
            box should be cropped from.

    Returns:
        A tensor of shape (n_bboxes, crop_height, crop_width, channels) of the same
        dtype as the input image. The crop size is inferred from the bounding box
        coordinates.

    Notes:
        This function expects bounding boxes with coordinates at the centers of the
        pixels in the box limits. Technically, the box will span (x1 - 0.5, x2 + 0.5)
        and (y1 - 0.5, y2 + 0.5).

        For example, a 3x3 patch centered at (1, 1) would be specified by
        (y1, x1, y2, x2) = (0, 0, 2, 2). This would be exactly equivalent to indexing
        the image with `image[:, :, 0:3, 0:3]`.
