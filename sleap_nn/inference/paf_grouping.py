"""This module provides a set of utilities for grouping peaks based on PAFs.

Part affinity fields (PAFs) are a representation used to resolve the peak grouping
problem for multi-instance pose estimation [1].

They are a convenient way to represent directed graphs with support in image space. For
each edge, a PAF can be represented by an image with two channels, corresponding to the
x and y components of a unit vector pointing along the direction of the underlying
directed graph formed by the connections of the landmarks belonging to an instance.

Given a pair of putatively connected landmarks, the agreement between the line segment
that connects them and the PAF vectors found at the coordinates along the same line can
be used as a measure of "connectedness". These scores can then be used to guide the
instance-wise grouping of landmarks.

This image space representation is particularly useful as it is amenable to neural
network-based prediction from unlabeled images.

A high-level API for grouping based on PAFs is provided through the `PAFScorer` class.

class PAFScorer:
    """Scoring pipeline based on part affinity fields.

    This class facilitates grouping of predicted peaks based on PAFs. It holds a set of
    common parameters that are used across different steps of the pipeline.

    Attributes:
        part_names: List of string node names in the skeleton.
        edges: List of (src_node, dst_node) names in the skeleton.
        pafs_stride: Output stride of the part affinity fields. This will be used to
            adjust the peak coordinates from full image to PAF subscripts.
        max_edge_length_ratio: The maximum expected length of a connected pair of points
            as a fraction of the image size. Candidate connections longer than this
            length will be penalized during matching.
        dist_penalty_weight: A coefficient to scale weight of the distance penalty as
            a scalar float. Set to values greater than 1.0 to enforce the distance
            penalty more strictly.
        n_points: Number of points to sample along the line integral.
        min_instance_peaks: Minimum number of peaks the instance should have to be
            considered a real instance. Instances with fewer peaks than this will be
            discarded (useful for filtering spurious detections).
        min_line_scores: Minimum line score (between -1 and 1) required to form a match
            between candidate point pairs. Useful for rejecting spurious detections when
            there are no better ones.
        edge_inds: The edges of the skeleton defined as a list of (source, destination)
            tuples of node indices. This is created automatically on initialization.
        edge_types: A list of `EdgeType` instances representing the edges of the
            skeleton. This is created automatically on initialization.
        n_nodes: The number of nodes in the skeleton as a scalar `int`. This is created
            automatically on initialization.
        n_edges: The number of edges in the skeleton as a scalar `int`. This is created
            automatically on initialization.
        sorted_edge_inds: A tuple of indices specifying the topological order that the
            edge types should be accessed in during instance assembly
            (`assign_connections_to_instances`).

    Notes:
        This class provides high level APIs for grouping peaks into instances using
        PAFs.

        The algorithm has three steps:

            1. Find all candidate connections between peaks and compute their matching
            score based on the PAFs.

            2. Match candidate connections using the connectivity score such that no
            peak is used in two connections of the same type.

            3. Group matched connections into complete instances.

        In general, the output from a peak finder (such as multi-peak confidence map
        prediction network) can be passed into `PAFScorer.predict()` to get back
        complete instances.

        For finer control over the grouping pipeline steps, use the instance methods in
        this class or the lower level functions in `sleap_nn.paf_grouping`.
