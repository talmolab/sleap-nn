# Contributing to sleap-nn

Thank you for your interest in contributing to sleap-nn! This guide will help you get started with development and contribution.

## Development Setup

1. **Install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and development dependencies**  
   `uv` is a fast and modern package manager for `pyproject.toml`-based projects. Refer [installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install uv.

2. **Install sleap-nn dependencies based on your platform**\

   - Sync all dependencies based on your correct wheel using `uv sync`:
     - **Windows/Linux with NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 11.8):**

      ```bash
      uv sync --extra dev --extra torch-cuda118
      ```

      - **Windows/Linux with NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.8):**

      ```bash
      uv sync --extra dev --extra torch-cuda128
      ```
     
     - **macOS with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4) or CPU-only (no GPU or unsupported GPU):** 
     Note: Even if torch-cpu is used on macOS, the MPS backend will be available.
     ```bash
      uv sync --extra dev --extra torch-cpu
      ```

   You can find the correct wheel for your system at:\

## Code Style

We follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) with these specifics:

- Use `black` for code formatting
- Use `ruff` for linting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints where possible

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
uv run black sleap_nn tests

# Check formatting
uv run black --check sleap_nn tests

# Run linter
uv run ruff check sleap_nn/
```

## Testing

We use `pytest` for testing. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=sleap_nn --cov-report=xml tests/

# Run tests with duration info
uv run pytest --durations=-1 tests/
```

## Documentation

### Writing Documentation

- Use Google-style docstrings
- First line should fit within 88 characters
- Use imperative tense (e.g., "Load X..." not "Loads X...")
- Use backticks for potential auto-linking
- Document array shapes and data types

Example:
```python
def load_tracks(filepath: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """Load the tracks from a SLEAP Analysis HDF5 file.

    Args:
        filepath: Path to a SLEAP Analysis HDF5 file.
    
    Returns:
        The loaded tracks as a `np.ndarray` of shape `(n_tracks, n_frames, n_nodes, 2)`.
    """
```

### Documentation Website Workflow

To work with the documentation locally:

1. **Clone the sleap-nn repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talmolab/sleap-nn.git
cd sleap-nn
```

2. Install `sleap-nn` with docs dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[docs]"
   ```

3. Build and tag a new documentation version:
   ```bash
   mike deploy --update-aliases 0.1.4 latest
   ```

4. Preview documentation locally:
   ```bash
   mike serve
   ```

5. Push a specific version manually:
   ```bash
   mike deploy --push --update-aliases --allow-empty 0.1.4 latest
   ```

The documentation is automatically deployed to https://nn.sleap.ai/ when changes are pushed to the main branch or when a new release is published.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and ensure tests pass

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

4. Push your branch and create a pull request

5. Ensure all CI checks pass

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Update tests and documentation as needed
- Follow the existing code style
- Add yourself to the contributors list if this is your first contribution
